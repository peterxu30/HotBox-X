# HotBox-X
Flappy Bird-esque game for Model Prediction Control Lab @ Berkeley. The goal is to develop models for human decision making by modifying game parameters and analyzing the game data.

**2019 Update**: The game is no longer hosted but game files are available in this repo should anyone wish to run it themselves. To see what the game looked like when it was running, take a look [here](https://github.com/peterxu30/HotBox-X-Server).
